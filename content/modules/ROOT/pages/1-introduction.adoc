Globex has been in business for a number of years with a core retail application written for a proprietary, expensive app server. They are now all-in on modernization to save costs and update to newer, open source products

== 1.1. First Step: Confirm Your Username!

Look in the box at the top of your screen. Is your username set already? If so it will look like this:

image::alreadyset.png[alreadyset]

If your `username` is properly set, then you can move on. *If not, in the above box, enter the user ID you were assigned* like this:

image::setuser.png[setuser]

This will customize the links and copy/paste code for this workshop. If you accidentally type the wrong username, just update your username in the URL parameters (e.g. ` 1-introduction.html?USERID=%USERID% ` )

[IMPORTANT]
====
You have to use *an unique username* (e.g. `%USERID%`) while you're running the hands-on labs. For example, you need to deploy applications to your own project (e.g. retail-%USERID%).
====

== 1.2. Click-to-Copy

You will see various code and command blocks throughout these exercises which can be copy/pasted directly by clicking anywhere on the block of text:

[.console-input]
[source,java]
----
/* A sample Java snippet that you can copy/paste by clicking */
public class CopyMeDirectly {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        System.out.println("You can copy this whole class with a click!");
    }
}
----

Simply click once and the whole block is copied to your clipboard, ready to be pasted with kbd:[CTRL+V] (or kbd:[Command+V] on Mac OS).

There are also Linux shell commands that can also be copied and pasted into a Terminal in your Development Environment:

[.console-input]
[source,bash,subs="+attributes,macros+"]
----
echo "This is a bash shell command that you can copy/paste by clicking"
----

== 1.3. The Workshop Environment You Are Using

Your workshop environment consists of several components which have been pre-installed and are ready to use. Depending on which
parts of the workshop you’re doing, you will use one or more of:

* https://www.redhat.com/en/technologies/jboss-middleware/application-platform[Red Hat JBoss Enterprise Application Platform^] delivers enterprise-grade security, performance, and scalability in any environment. Whether on-premise; virtual; or in private, public, or hybrid clouds, JBoss EAP can help you deliver apps faster, everywhere. You'll migrate the existing monolithic Java application on WebLogic to a cloud-native Java application server, JBoss EAP.
* https://developers.redhat.com/products/openshift-dev-spaces/overview[Red Hat OpenShift Dev Spaces^] built on the open source Eclipse Che project, Red Hat OpenShift Dev Spaces uses Kubernetes and containers to provide developers and other IT team members with a consistent, secure, and zero-configuration development environment. The experience is as fast and familiar as an integrated development environment (IDE) on your laptop. You’ll write, test, and deploy code from here.
* https://developers.redhat.com/products/mta/overview[Migration Toolkit for Applications^]  helps development teams modernize and migrate their applications to Red Hat OpenShift. It provides a set of tools and best practices to accelerate the journey to Kubernetes.

You’ll be provided selectable URLs throughout the workshop to access the services that have been installed for you.

== Congratulations!

You have now successfully confirmed your workshop environment with Red Hat tools and products you will use today.

In the next step, you'll begin the modernization process by analyzing the monolithic applications to identify issues and risks that will need to be considered as during the modernization journey.
